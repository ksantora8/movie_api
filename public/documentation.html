    <h1> myFlix Application API </h1>
    <p> The goal of this project is to develop the backend component of an app called myFlix. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this app is to let users view a searchable list of movies and their associated data (genre, director, release year, etc.).</p>
    <p> New users will be able to create an account so they can save and remove movies from a list of their favorites. </p>
    <p> Existing users will be able to update their account information or deregister as needed. </p>
    <p> This API will be created using a MERN stack.</p>
